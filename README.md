# DISCORD BATTLE BOT #

WE ARE DEVELOPING A BATTLE BOT FOR DISCORD.

IT FUNCTIONS AS AN ELO SYSTEM ON A DISCORD SERVER.

A USER CAN RUN "!TRAIN" COMMAND IN DISCORD TO EITHER TRAIN VIGOUR, STRENGTH OR ENDURANCE.

ONCE A WEEK, EVERYONE WHO IS SIGNED UP ON THE DISCORD SERVER, WILL GET A RANDOM OPPONENT AT THE END OF THE WEEK.

THE WINNER GETS +ELO AND THE LOSER GETS -ELO.

STATS UP THE CHANCE TO WIN YOUR FIGHT.

THERE WILL BE A SERVER LEADERBOARD WHICH SHOWS THE SERVER CHAMPIONS.

HAVE FUN!
